# Space-Invasion

# Overview

This game is like space invaders there are aliens invading earth and it is your job to make sure they don't reach it so you fire bullets at the enemies to destroy them while dodging their bullets as well. the big blue boss is fully protected until all the other enemies are gone then he is vulnerable and can get hurt by your bullets.

How to play you use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship left and right or A and D, to fire your bullets you push the space bar.

I made this game because I thought it seemed simple enough to make and it seemed like a fun way to make a game since I have never made a game before it was a lot of fun to make and to make it more challenging or make it more simple and seeing how much coding actually goes into making a simple game.

# Development Environment

I used VS code as the editor and I used python as the language with arcade as the framework and way to run the game.
